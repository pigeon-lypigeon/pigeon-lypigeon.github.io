    <h3>First, something on hacking</h3>
    <h4>It's more related than you may think</h4>

        With hacking, we've all seen it in films:  some sort of baggy hoodie or apparel, reflective glasses, lines of green code 
        being written at ungodly speeds, techno thumping in the background, and depending on how dramatic the story is, maybe the occasional cut to some
        corporation heads freaking out.<br>
        The truth of the matter is that, (for the most part) this isn't how it is. Firstly, to what I know at least, most hackers are more sensible than
        going after expansive corporations 
        with herculean legal teams, and secondly, not all hacking occurs with some evil plot or malicious plan behind the wheel. Hacking, as it turns out,
        is an important
        aspect of cybersecurity.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After all, if a certified person can enter a network, perhaps via
        a backdoor, or some exploit,
        then they can notify the team, and the software can be patched, hopefully preventing other people from entering that way.
        This hacking with the intent of improving security rather than exploiting it is known as "White Hat, (or Ethical) Hacking", and you can actually get
        certified for it!

    <h3>
        Cyber defense
    </h3>
    <p>
        There is much to be said in the terms of direct cyber defense: There are obvious things that can be done with (what should be) common sense:

        Don't accept free calls or trips to the carribean, maybe the Nigerian prince that you've been
         chatting with doesn't actually have millions of dollars,
        no real business or trustworthy company outsource is going to require money in the form of gift cards, the like. 
       
        (there is a lot more than just blatant shifty practitioners that 
        prey on old people who can't tell what's going on, I will source some info on that below.)

        There are some methods (which are also linked below) for reducing the opportunities for data, or program info, or anything of the sort to be hacked.
        
        This, however, is where my knowledge ends. I have some info on "defensive coding", which can be found below, however.

        <h1> Citations / More information</h1>
        <p>
            I can assure you that these will hold far more information than I have found.
             On top of that, they will likely cover them with more depth, so, for more information,
              feel free to consult Google, and the following few sources that I actually remembered (oops) to cite.

        <h2> On the different moralities of hacking:</h2>
        <p>
            (The hacking hat image has links but I'll post them here too)
            This information is all over the place, I've seen a couple youtube videos, but here's what I'm referring to now.
            <a href="https://cyberquote.com/blog/know-your-hackers-white-hat-black-hat-grey-hat/" >
                here it is, if you are interested in it.
